# Hand-Gesture-Recognition
This project focuses on a hand gesture recognition system that utilizes various Python libraries, including Mediapipe, Pytesseract, PyAutoGUI, and OpenCV, to provide a touch-free interaction experience with digital devices. Key features include:
Mouse Control: Allows users to control the mouse pointer using hand gestures.
PowerPoint Control: Enables navigation through slides during presentations.
Media Player Control: Provides gesture-based control over media playback.
Whiteboard Functionality: Facilitates collaborative whiteboarding through gestures.
Handwriting to Text Conversion: Converts written handwriting into digital text using Pytesseract, with the model trained using transfer learning on a labeled dataset.
The system's real-time hand tracking and gesture recognition capabilities offer an intuitive user experience, making it useful in various applications such as for handicapped individuals, school or office presentations, medical sectors, and any environment requiring a touch-free interaction.
